## Decisions Detail

### phase-03-videos/TD-01

**Recommendation:** it is the only option that combines ready-made job semantics (attempts/backoff/failed state, which TD-07 consumes directly), an official NestJS 11 integration, and a dedicated queue service visibly running in Compose. RabbitMQ buys generality the phase doesn't need at the cost of hand-rolled retry topology; pg-boss buys simplicity at the cost of making the phase's queue deliverable invisible.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-02

**Recommendation:** the only option that satisfies 10GB + no-bytes-through-API + resumability using nothing but the storage already in the stack. tus adds a new trust boundary and infrastructure for resumability that multipart already provides at the granularity the phase needs.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-03

**Recommendation:** matches the C4 diagram's separate Video Worker container while reusing every existing convention (config namespaces, TypeORM, testing), at the cost of a shared image that is irrelevant at this scale.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-04

**Recommendation:** the wrapper everyone would reach for is dead, the plumbing is small, and installing ffmpeg in the worker image is the natural move in a project where everything already runs in containers.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-05

**Recommendation:** equivalent guarantees to nanoid without inheriting its ESM-only packaging problem in a CommonJS build, reusing the collision-retry pattern the codebase already established for nicknames.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-06

**Recommendation:** consistent with the upload principle (API orchestrates, storage moves bytes), gets Range/206 and attachment download from S3 semantics for free, and keeps HLS as a clean future evolution rather than a phase-03 obligation.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-07

**Recommendation:** implements the plan's cycle exactly, delegates failure handling to the queue's proven retry mechanics, and keeps state-machine surface minimal for the phase.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-08

**Recommendation:** the architecture explicitly frames MinIO as "same API as S3, swapped in production"; coding against the official S3 SDK keeps that swap to configuration only, and its presigner covers every URL TD-02/TD-06 need.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-09

**Recommendation:** the phase has one access pattern (presigned, private); colocated artifacts and single-bucket bootstrap are concretely simpler, and a future split remains possible behind the storage service abstraction.
**Libraries:** —

## Inherited Decisions Detail

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/config) — Official, core-team-maintained, guaranteed NestJS 11 compatibility. The `registerAs()` factory pattern solves the TypeORM CLI sharing problem: the factory function can be imported as a plain function by `data-source.ts` while also serving as a DI injection token inside NestJS. Building a custom module recreates solved functionality; third-party packages carry maintenance risk.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/config@^4.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (Joi) — First-class integration with `@nestjs/config` via `validationSchema`, requiring zero custom wiring. Handles string-to-number coercion natively. Using a different tool for env validation vs. request validation is reasonable — env config is validated once at startup, DTOs are validated per-request. Zod is elegant but adds a third validation paradigm to the project.
**Libraries:** `joi@^17.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option B (Namespaced/grouped with registerAs) — The project roadmap explicitly calls for auth, email, and storage in upcoming phases. Namespaced configs provide clear file boundaries per domain, typed injection via `ConfigType<typeof databaseConfig>`, and natural scalability. The `registerAs()` factory is dual-purpose: DI token inside NestJS and plain importable function for `data-source.ts`. Initial files for Phase 01: `src/config/database.config.ts`, `src/config/app.config.ts`.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option A (Shared registerAs factory) — Natural outcome of choosing `@nestjs/config` with `registerAs`. The factory is already callable by design. `data-source.ts` imports it, calls `dotenv.config()`, then calls the factory. Zero duplication, minimal code, no extra abstraction.
**Libraries:** `dotenv` (transitive via `@nestjs/config`)

### phase-02-auth/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Argon2id — For a greenfield project in 2026, Argon2id is the OWASP-recommended choice. The native build dependency is a one-time Docker setup cost. The project has no legacy constraints favoring bcrypt. OWASP minimum: 19MiB memory, 2 iterations.
**Libraries:** `argon2@^0.41.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/passport) — The project plan includes only email/password auth for now, but the plugin architecture costs little and future phases may add social login. Aligns with official NestJS docs, making onboarding and maintenance easier.
**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation during implementation — custom guards were preferred over `@nestjs/passport` to keep the dependency surface smaller; social login is not on the near-term roadmap, so the plugin-architecture benefit did not justify the extra abstraction layer.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option A (Refresh Token Rotation) — Provides the strongest security model with automatic theft detection. The DB write overhead is acceptable for a video platform (auth refresh is infrequent vs. video operations). PostgreSQL is already in the stack, so no new infrastructure needed. Race conditions can be mitigated with a short grace period for the old token.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option B (Random Opaque Tokens in DB) — Revocability is important: when a user requests a new password reset, previous tokens should be invalidated. The DB table is trivial to implement, and the tokens table can also serve future needs (e.g., API keys). Keeps email tokens decoupled from the JWT auth system.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs-modules/mailer) — Best NestJS integration with minimal boilerplate. Supports SMTP (matching the architecture diagram), works with MailHog/Mailpit for local development without external dependencies, and scales to any SMTP provider in production. Template engine support (Handlebars) simplifies email formatting. No vendor lock-in.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs-modules/mailer@^2.x`, `handlebars@^4.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Option A (class-validator + class-transformer) — This is a backend-only project (no shared schemas with frontend), so Zod's single-source-of-truth advantage is less impactful. class-validator is the documented NestJS approach, and the project already uses decorators extensively (TypeORM entities, NestJS DI). Fewer integration surprises with NestJS 11.
**Libraries:** `class-validator@^0.14.x`, `class-transformer@^0.5.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Option A (Custom Domain Exception Filter) — Provides machine-readable error codes that the Next.js frontend can switch on, without the overhead of RFC 9457's URI-based type system. The project is single-consumer (first-party frontend), so a simple `{ statusCode, error, message }` format with domain codes balances clarity and simplicity. The custom filter cost is low — two small files.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-08

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/throttler) — Native NestJS integration is decisive: the guard system allows scoping rate limiting to `AuthModule` only via module-level `APP_GUARD`, with `@SkipThrottle()` for exemptions. The project is single-instance with no distributed requirements, so in-memory storage is sufficient. Using express-rate-limit would bypass NestJS's DI and guard lifecycle for no clear benefit.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/throttler@^6.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-09

**Recommendation:** Option B (Opaque) — Since DB lookup is mandatory (TD-03), JWT signature adds no security value. Opaque tokens are shorter, leak no data, and are simpler to generate.
**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation — JWT was kept to reuse the access-token signing/verification infrastructure (`@nestjs/jwt`), trading token size and base64-readability for a single token format across the codebase.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-10

**Recommendation:** Option A — The platform is a video sharing service with URL-based channel handles. A strict `[a-z0-9_]` allowlist is the simplest and most portable choice: no extra dependencies, no edge cases around hyphen positioning, and the `user_<random>` fallback provides a valid handle even for extreme email prefixes. Hyphens can always be added in a future iteration if user feedback justifies it.
**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-01

**Recommendation:** é a única opção que preserva as decisões anteriores (`class-validator` em TD-06 de phase-02-auth) sem re-platform; o CLI plugin com `classValidatorShim: true` aproveita os decoradores `class-validator` existentes para inferir schemas, mantendo o boilerplate baixo. Nestia tem mérito técnico real mas o custo de migração do stack de validação inviabiliza-a sem uma decisão upstream de supersede de TD-06. Manual authoring é descartado.
**Libraries:** @nestjs/swagger

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-02

**Recommendation:** o custo marginal sobre Option A é apenas um npm script (~15 linhas) e o benefício é uma fundação correta para futura integração FE (codegen offline) sem perder a UI interativa que dev/QA usam. Option B sozinho pune a experiência de desenvolvimento em dev/local; Option A sozinho compromete o pipeline de codegen futuro. Combinar é dominante.
**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-03

**Recommendation:** alinha com a postura defensiva já estabelecida em phase 02 e não compromete consumidores legítimos (o `openapi.json` commitado em TD-02 cumpre o papel de "spec consultável fora da UI"). Re-abrir como Option A ou C é trivial no futuro se um caso de uso de API pública aparecer.
**Libraries:** —

_(phase-02-auth-frontend TDs omitted from inheritance: they govern the Next.js BFF/session/forms surface, which is out of scope for this backend-only phase; they remain on disk for the phase that resumes frontend work.)_

## Inherited Conventions

- Backend config uses `@nestjs/config` with namespaced `registerAs(name, () => ({...}))` factories — one file per domain in `src/config/`. _(from phase 01)_
- Env variables are validated by a Joi schema in `src/config/env.validation.ts`, passed to `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validationSchema, validationOptions: ... })`. _(from phase 01)_
- Config is injected into modules via `ConfigType<typeof xxxConfig>` and `@Inject(xxxConfig.KEY)`; the same factory is importable as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- `data-source.ts` loads `.env` via `import 'dotenv/config'` at the top, then imports `databaseConfig` and calls it as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- Database connection parameters (host, port, etc.) are sourced from a single `databaseConfig` factory — never duplicated between `AppModule` and the CLI. _(from phase 01)_
- `TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync` is used (not `forRoot`), with `imports: [ConfigModule]`, `inject: [databaseConfig.KEY]`, `useFactory` returning options. _(from phase 01)_

## Inherited Deferred Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Origin phase | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Telas de frontend | deferred | phase-01-configuracao-base | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha | deferred | phase-02-auth | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| "Confirmação de conta via e-mail com link de ativação" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — UI landing screen de-scoped 2026-05-14; FE confirmation flow (TD-07) picked up by a future phase. BE side unchanged in `phase-02-auth`. |
| "Logout" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — logout button lives inside authenticated chrome (typically Phase 04). Phase 02 still implements POST `/api/auth/logout` (BFF route handler + `session.destroy()`) so the contract is ready when the chrome lands. |
| "Recuperação de senha (destination screen / set-new-password)" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — `/forgot-password` ships this phase sending the e-mail; the reset-password destination screen is absent from Figma → link destination remains a 404 until a later phase delivers the screen via `/screen-inventory` extension run. Documented as a known gap. |
| "Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | a tela de confirmação da conta não será implementada nesta fase corrente, será adiada — the umbrella bullet's full coverage requires the confirmação and reset-password destination screens; both are deferred per Non-UI rows above. The 3 ship-this-phase telas (signup, login, forgot-password) are inventoried and covered by their own verbs; the umbrella bullet itself is deferred to the phase that lands the missing screens. |

## Non-UI / Deferred Capabilities

_None._

## Testing Requirements

### nestjs-project

| Artifact type | Required layers |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Entity (`*.entity.ts`) | Integration: constraints, defaults, `select: false` |
| Service with branching + DB | Unit: branch logic (mock repo) + Integration: DB contract |
| Service with DB only (no branching) | Integration: DB contract |
| Service with configured lib (JWT, cache) | Unit: real lib with test config |
| Service with side-effect dep (email, storage) | Integration: real capture service (Mailpit) or local adapter |
| Module with configured imports | Unit: compilation test |
| Controller | E2E only — do NOT write unit tests |
| DTO | E2E: one validation wiring test per endpoint |
| Guard (delegates to service for business logic) | E2E + Unit if complex internal logic |
| Guard (simple, delegates to Passport) | E2E only |
| Pipe (custom transformation/validation) | Unit |
| Interceptor (response transform, logging) | Unit and/or E2E |
| Exception Filter | Unit + E2E |
| Middleware | E2E |

_Additional guide notes relevant to this phase: module DI wiring tests must cover configured imports such as `BullModule.registerQueue()`; service-to-external-system contracts (storage uploads, queue publishing) are worth integration tests against the real Compose services; race conditions on concurrent video uploads are explicitly listed as worth testing._

### next-frontend

_Deferred subproject — no work in this phase; testing requirements will apply when video UI phases begin._
